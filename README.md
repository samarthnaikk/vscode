# DotBot

This repository is a **fork of [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)**. It is built on top of the original VS Code codebase, but introduces additional features and improvements that are not available in the official VS Code release.

## Key Points

- Based on the official VS Code project
- Includes unique features and enhancements missing from upstream VS Code
- Maintains compatibility with most extensions and workflows

## Why This Fork?

While VS Code is a powerful and extensible editor, this fork aims to address limitations and add new capabilities requested by the community or required for specific workflows. See the documentation and changelog for details on the extra features provided.

## Getting Started

Refer to the original VS Code documentation for general usage. For fork-specific features, see the [docs](./docs/) folder or the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).
